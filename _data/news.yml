#    We are looking to recruit **12 fully-funded PhD students** to work with us on [accessible data representations](/pubs/#tag=accessibility), [interpretable/explainable](/pubs/#tag=machine-learning-interpretability) AI & human-AI alignment, or [malleable interfaces & LLMs](/pubs/#tag=malleable-interfaces). 
#    
#
#    Apply through [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/) (deadline: **Dec 15, 2023**). The MIT EECS website lists a number of resources to help with the application process. For instance, consider signing up with [MIT EECS GAAP](https://eecs-gaap.mit.edu/) to receive mentorship about your application from a current MIT EECS PhD student.
