# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# To run localhost on windows change this to 4.3.3 and comment line 33. Then undo these changes before pushing code!
# To run localhost, bundle install, then bundle exec jekyll serve
